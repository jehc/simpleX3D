take out get/set silently... use .value
remove node deletion from proto stuff
test shallow clone
since specialized fields subclass SAIField, don't put Definition* in there... put it as a base of InField etc.
test that special fields can be cloned
when we have real node gc, this is how routes get deleted:
    mark nodes
    iterate routes
        if source marked but not target, remove from target incoming
        if target marked but not source, remove from source outgoing
        if source or target marked, delete
    sweep nodes
